Sarah Kuczyk Personal-Project
================

During the duration of this course I was required to spend a great deal of time crawling through website structures and altering CSS files. Some of the more technical problems that needed to be solved were done through the use of finding direct problems in the HTML, CSS, and PHP code for the OneClickMed auction website.

For this personal project, I'll display the extra HTML and CSS abilities I picked up by demonstrating one of the objectives we had to bypass during our project with OneClickMed: the login and register buttons. Code will remain dormant to protect the integrity of the OneClickMed auction website.
